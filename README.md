# Exo-DMC
Exoplanet Detection Map Calculator 


If you find a bug or want to suggest improvements, please create a [ticket](https://github.com/mbonav/Exo-DMC/issues)

# Requirements:

The package also relies on usual packages for data science and astronomy: [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/).

# Installation: 
The easiest is to install `Exo-DMC` using `pip`:

```javascript
pip install Exo-DMC
```
                                                   
Otherwise your can download the current repository and install the package manually:

```javascript
cd Exo-DMC/
python setup.py install
```

# Examples
The package is not fully documented, but [examples]() are provided.
